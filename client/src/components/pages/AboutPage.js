            <p>
                In 2005, while working for the original McGill family business The North Rocks Greenery,
                Jon McGill took on his first Garden Maintenance job armed with just a pair of secateurs.
            </p>
            <p>
                The business grew significantly, servicing Sydney's Hills District, and expanded to certified Landscaping services.
                The McGill family then re-branded their business after selling the Nursery.

                Under it's new name, <b className='about-company-name'>Looking Up Landscapes</b>
                services the Central Coast through to Newcastle and the Hunter Valley.

            <p>
                <b>Integrity: </b>We seek to provide a quality product,
                informed by your desires and expectations,
                for a price that genuinely represents that product.

            <p>
                <b>Excellence: </b>We seek to go beyond ‘good enough’
                to ‘really well done’. Providing a product that lasts,
                that achieves results aesthetically and functionally and,
                ultimately, exceeds your expectations.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Genuine Care: </b>We seek to be people who provide
                not just a physical product, but a valuable service
                that is sensitive to needs of each customer as well as their
                personal and family space.
